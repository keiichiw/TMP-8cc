# TMP-8cc: Another Compile-time C Compiler (does NOT work!)

[TMP-8cc](https://github.com/kw-udon/TMP-8cc) is a compile-time C compiler implemented in C++ *T*emplate *M*eta*P*rogramming.
This project is a port of [8cc](https://github.com/rui314/8cc) built on [ELVM Infrastructure](https://github.com/shinh/elvm).

However, this compiler **DOES NOT** work on practial machines, because it needs unrealistically much RAM.
Therefore, this compiler is **ornamental**.
