# TMP-8cc: Another Compile-time C Compiler

[TMP-8cc](https://github.com/kw-udon/TMP-8cc) is a compile-time C compiler implemented in **C++ Template MetaProgramming**.
This project is a port of [8cc](https://github.com/rui314/8cc) and generated by [ELVM Infrastructure](https://github.com/shinh/elvm)'s [C++ Template Metaprogramming backend](https://github.com/shinh/elvm/pull/39).

However, this compiler unfortunately **DOES NOT** work on practial machines, because it needs huge amount of memories.
Therefore, this compiler is **ornamental**.
